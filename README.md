## 1. PROJECT ABSTRACT

Riverside Public Library requires a book management system to maintain their expanding collection. The system will catalog books, track availability, and generate reports using Python's list comprehension and related operations. This console application demonstrates advanced list comprehension techniques while allowing librarians to efficiently manage the library's collection. The system performs critical functions including categorizing books by genre, filtering by availability, transforming book data, and calculating collection statistics. By implementing these operations with Python list comprehension, the system provides an efficient way for library staff to organize and analyze their collection.

## 2. BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS

1. System needs to store and categorize different genres of books (fiction, non-fiction, reference, children's, biography)
2. System must support filtering books by genre, availability, publication decade, or keyword
3. Console should handle different list comprehension operations:
   - Basic filtering (books by genre, availability)
   - Transforming data (formatting titles, creating citation strings)
   - Nested list comprehension (for multi-criteria filtering)
   - List comprehension with conditionals (if-else structures)

## 3. CONSTRAINTS

### 3.1 INPUT REQUIREMENTS

1. Book Records:
   - Must be stored as dictionaries with fields for id, title, author, genre, publication_year, available, popularity_score

   - Must be stored as boolean in "available" field
   - Must be True (available) or False (on loan)
   - Example: True

4. Popularity Score:
   - Must be stored as float in "popularity_score" field
   - Must be between 1.0-5.0
   - Example: 4.5

     - `{"id": "B001", "title": "Python Fundamentals", "author": "John Smith", "genre": "reference", "publication_year": 2019, "available": True, "popularity_score": 4.5}`
     - `{"id": "B002", "title": "Mystery at Midnight", "author": "Jane Doe", "genre": "fiction", "publication_year": 2018, "available": False, "popularity_score": 4.2}`
     - `{"id": "B003", "title": "History of Computing", "author": "Alan Turing", "genre": "non-fiction", "publication_year": 2015, "available": True, "popularity_score": 3.8}`
     - `{"id": "B004", "title": "The Dragon's Quest", "author": "Emily Johnson", "genre": "children", "publication_year": 2020, "available": True, "popularity_score": 4.7}`
     - `{"id": "B005", "title": "Life of Einstein", "author": "Robert Brown", "genre": "biography", "publication_year": 2017, "available": False, "popularity_score": 4.1}`

6. New Arrivals:
   - Must use these exact predefined items in the new arrivals list:
     - `{"id": "N001", "title": "Data Science Handbook", "author": "Sarah Miller", "genre": "reference", "publication_year": 2023, "available": True, "popularity_score": 4.9}`
     - `{"id": "N002", "title": "Quantum Physics Simplified", "author": "Richard Feynman", "genre": "non-fiction", "publication_year": 2022, "available": True, "popularity_score": 4.3}`

### 3.2 OPERATION CONSTRAINTS

1. Book List Combination:
   - Must use list comprehension to combine lists with additional transformation
   - Example: `[{**book, "section": "New"} for book in new_arrivals]`

2. Book Filtering by Genre:
   - Must use list comprehension
   - Example: `[book for book in books if book["genre"] == "fiction"]`

3. Available Books Filtering:
   - Must use list comprehension
   - Example: `[book for book in books if book["available"] == True]`

4. Book Title Transformation:
   - Must use list comprehension with string operations
   - Example: `[book["title"].upper() for book in books]`

5. Multi-criteria Filtering:
   - Must use list comprehension with multiple conditions
   - Example: `[book for book in books if book["genre"] == "reference" and book["available"] == True]`

6. Book Publication Decade Filtering:
   - Must use list comprehension with calculated conditions
   - Example: `[book for book in books if book["publication_year"] // 10 == 201]` (for 2010s)

7. Book Citation Generation:
   - Must use list comprehension with formatted strings
   - Example: `[f"{book['author']} ({book['publication_year']}). {book['title']}." for book in books]`

8. Conditional Transformation:
   - Must use list comprehension with if-else
   - Example: `[book["title"] if book["available"] else f"{book['title']} (ON LOAN)" for book in books]`
